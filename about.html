                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>I am a chemical engineering undergraduate at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), one of the most prestigious engineering institutions in Bangladesh. My academic journey has been marked by consistent excellence, achieving a perfect GPA of 5.00 in both SSC and HSC examinations.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond academics, I have demonstrated leadership and technical prowess through various competitions. As team leader, I led my team to victory in the National Laminar Competition 2024 and secured runner-up position in the National Chem-E-Car competition 2023. These experiences have honed my skills in team management, problem-solving, and practical application of chemical engineering principles.</p>
                
                <p>I am deeply passionate about research and aspire to make significant contributions to the field of chemical engineering. My goal is to work on innovative solutions that can address real-world challenges and make a positive impact on society.</p>
